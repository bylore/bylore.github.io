In this talk, a phase field model is shared to investigate the coupling evolution behaviour of polarization, fracture and dielectric breakdown in ferroelectric materials subjected to the mechanical and electrical loadings. The present talk and discussion provide an insight into fracture and breakdown coupling failure mechanism in ferroelectric materials. The model framework can be employed to investigate more complex coupling failure behaviours of ferroelectric and dielectric materials.
