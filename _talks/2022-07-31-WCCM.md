Ferroelectric materials have attracted increasing attention due to their distinguished electromechanical performance. In the presence of mechanical and electrical loadings, the failure behaviours of fracture and dielectric breakdown may occur simultaneously in ferroelectric materials. Understanding the coupling evolution of fracture, dielectric breakdown and polarization is crucial for the application of ferroelectric materials under complex electromechanical environments. In this talk, a phase field model is shared to investigate the coupling evolution behaviour of polarization, fracture and dielectric breakdown in ferroelectric materials subjected to the mechanical and electrical loadings. The present talk and discussion provide an insight into fracture and breakdown coupling failure mechanism in ferroelectric materials. The model framework can be employed to investigate more complex coupling failure behaviours of ferroelectric and dielectric materials.
