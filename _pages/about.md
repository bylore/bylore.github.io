Hi I am Yong Zhang, currently working as an Assistant Professor at [School of Aerospace Engineering and Applied Mechanics](https://aero-mech.tongji.edu.cn/English/list.htm) at [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/p/#/). I was supported by the [Chenguang Program](http://www.shedf.org.cn/html/chenguangjihua_jianjie.html) of Shanghai Education Development Foundation and Shanghai Municipal Education Commission. As the Principal Investigator (PI), I am leading two projects supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China. Prior to joining Tongji, I worked as a post-doc researcher in the group lead by Professor [Jie Wang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/jiewang#0). Before that, I obtained my doctoral degree in Mechanics at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in China, under the supervision of Professor [Pizhong Qiao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Rb_idV0AAAAJ&hl=zh-TW) I got my bachelor's degree at School of Mechanical Engineering & Automation at Beihang University.

My main research interests lie in the functional and failure behaviors of smart/composite materials as well as the corresponding computational models and methods, specifically including
* Peridynamics theories and methods for fracture of solids;
* Phase field modeling for microstructure evolution (crack propagation, dielectric breakdown, dendrite growth, ferroelectric domain switching et. al.);
* Functional and failure behaviors of smart/composite materials in multiphysics environment;
* Application of artificial intelligence methods for material functional and failure behaviors.

For more information please find my CV [here](https://yongzh.space/cv/).

Please don't hesitate to contact me for potential communication and collaboration. 

I am also looking for motivated master students. So if you are interested in my research and would like to work with me, please also feel free to reach out!
